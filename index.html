						Hello! I'm Dexter and I'm a beagle - probably the coolest one out there. If you're an outdoor guy, I'd love for you to take me out. I am all about the grass and hot granite.
						<br><br>
						You should meet my hooman. She's a real pal. And guess what? She is amazing at taking pictures of me. Or perhaps, ahem.. I might just be photogenic! Anyways, thanks for taking the time to be here. Can't wait to meet you!
						<br>
						Ruff.

					<p>
						I want to share with you the secret to my joy and bubbly personality. It is the way I perceive life. No matter how much negativity is there around you, a touch of positive energy can bring about a massive change which has a rippling effect. You will find a silent room filled with laughter when I enter. Anybody can emit good vibes.
